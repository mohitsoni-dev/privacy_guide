### **Text-based Messaging:**

Never use garbage like Whatsapp, Skype, Snapchat, SMS or Discord. Nothing you do on those applications is private. Telegram isn't much better.

Always favor applications that have strong encryption, an open source code and run on a decentralized network.

 **Great tier:**

 * Jami: https://jami.net/  (Peer-to-peer, open source, easy to use, strong encryption, multi-platform, great choice) (use it with a VPN, Orbot or a DHT Proxy)

 * Briar: https://briarproject.org/ (Peer-to-peer, even more secure than Jami, maximum privacy, routed through Tor, Android only)

 * Session: https://getsession.org/ (Decentralized servers, open source, strong encryption, very secure)

 * XMPP: https://xmpp.org/ (Galaxy-brained choice if you self-host)

   - For XMPP Server Software, consider [Prosody](https://prosody.im/) ([Guide](https://homebrewserver.club/configuring-a-modern-xmpp-server.html)) or [ejabberd](https://www.ejabberd.im/)

   - For XMPP Client Software (apps), consider [Conversations](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.siacs.conversations/) (Android), [Gajim](https://gajim.org/) (Windows/Linux Desktop) or God forbid, [Siskin](https://siskin.im/) (iOS) (Make your iPhone-using family & friends use Siskin or [ChatSecure](https://chatsecure.org/))

 **Okay tier:**

 * Wickr: https://wickr.com/ (Very private and strong encryption, but closed source)

 * Tox: https://tox.chat/ (Peer-to-peer, but highly experimental protocol)

 * Threema: https://threema.ch/ (Very secure, Centralized, popular in Europe)

 **Who needs the internet for chatting?**

 * Beechat: https://beechat.network/

### **Chat Servers:**

Never use garbage like Discord under any circumstance, and more importantly, **NEVER DOWNLOAD THE APP**. It's spyware and fiercely pro-censorship.

Consider the following alternatives for privacy, security and decentralization:

 * Element: https://element.io/ (Read about Matrix [here](https://glowers.club/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:newfriends))

   - Cool Element Servers: https://glowers.club/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:homeservers

 * RocketChat: https://rocket.chat/ (More for productivity and collaboration, but some prefer it to Element)

 * Mattermost: https://mattermost.com/ (see RocketChat)

 * Mumble:  https://www.mumble.info/ (The best voice-chat software, very easy to set up)

 * Guilded: https://www.guilded.gg/ (Not private, and not great, but extremely similar to Discord in functionality, while not being Discord. Divide the market)

  - If you absolutely must use Discord, use it in your browser (especially Ungoogled Chromium). **Do NOT download the Discord app under any circumstance. It will spy on your running tasks**

#### **Video Conferencing:**

 * Instead of Zoom, use Jitsi: https://jitsi.org/


### **Email:**

It should go without saying but never use Gmail, Outlook/Hotmail, Yahoomail, Yandex or any of those other big-name Email providers. They can see your emails, and will look through them if they ever need to.

For unimportant things like forum registrations, consider free, disposable email services like [Mailinator](https://www.mailinator.com/) or [MailDrop](https://maildrop.cc/), or temporary email services like [MinuteInbox](https://www.minuteinbox.com/) or [10MinuteMail](https://10minutemail.com/).

For more important exchanges, consider one of the smaller, privacy-focused providers below, and if you can, use email encryption software like [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/software/frontends.html).

 * https://nixnet.email/

 * https://www.msgsafe.io/

 * https://www.criptext.com

 * https://cock.li/

 * https://dismail.de/

 * https://disroot.org/

 * https://mailfence.com/

 * https://tutanota.com/

#### **Email Clients:**

Never use Outlook Express/Windows Live Mail, and try to avoid Mozilla Thunderbird. Consider:

 * Claws: https://www.claws-mail.org/

 * K-9 Mail: https://k9mail.app/ (Android)

 * Rainloop: https://www.rainloop.net/ ([Supports Nextcloud integration](https://github.com/pierre-alain-b/rainloop-nextcloud))

 * KMail: https://kontact.kde.org/components/kmail.html

 * Evolution: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution
